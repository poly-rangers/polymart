### Introducing the team behind **Polymart** 🙇‍♀️🙇‍♂️
**The Polyrangers!** Led by El, together with Sol, Hanna, Jia, Ken, Ashley and Eli, we aim to bridge the gap between buyers and sellers.

### 🫡 Future Development
Meet-up locations are restricted to the main campus of PUP Sta. Mesa. Polymart will not (yet) support reversible features of selling and buying at the same time. Update of transactions have to be manually updated by the seller. And Polymart will not be using paid API and database features, therefore limiting the features it will be able to utilize.
